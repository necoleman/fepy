## Finite elements in python.

> Currently for computing Laplace spectra of planar domains.

Critical dependency: the [Triangle](http://dzhelil.info/triangle/) library.

Useful: Matplotlib, tkinter.

Next steps:

* GUI for drawing & working with planar domains

* Adaptive mesh refinement
  - Nodal sets
  - Controlling geometric sources of error
